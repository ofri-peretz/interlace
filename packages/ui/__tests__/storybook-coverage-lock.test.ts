/**
 * Storybook Coverage Lock
 *
 * Every primitive in `packages/ui/src/primitives/*.tsx` must have a matching
 * story in `apps/storybook/src/stories/primitives/*.stories.tsx`.
 *
 * Storybook is the visual contract surface for the design system — addon-a11y
 * + addon-themes run axe + dark-mode against every story in CI. A primitive
 * without a story is invisible to that gate, so visual / a11y regressions in
 * it ship silently. See LAYOUT_PHILOSOPHY.md, COLOR_PHILOSOPHY.md.
 *
 * History: prior to 2026-05-13 the layout primitives (Container, Section,
 * Stack) had stories in `packages/ui/src/stories/` but NOT in the runnable
 * `apps/storybook` host. Both trees existed in parallel and drifted.
 * The fix consolidated stories into `apps/storybook` and added this lock so
 * a future primitive can't be added without its story.
