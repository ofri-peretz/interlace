/**
 * InterlaceWeave — the brand gesture as an interaction signature.
 *
 * ## RFC (R3)
 *
 * Two thin strands — brand orange (`strand-a`) and its cool complement (`strand-b`),
 * the mark's own pair — draw along a surface's border from OPPOSITE
 * corners on hover/focus and overshoot past each other where they meet:
 * the name, enacted. Decorative overlay only; the host surface keeps its
 * own semantics, focus ring, and content.
 *
 * Travel signal (R2): HIGH — designed as a system gesture (cards now;
 * CTAs, inputs, doc panels later). Ship once here, reuse everywhere: a
 * memorable touch only compounds if it is ONE touch.
 *
 * ## Mechanics
 *
 * Pure CSS/SVG — zero JS, zero bundle beyond this file. Each strand is a
 * rounded-rect path normalized with `pathLength={100}` and revealed by a
 * `stroke-dashoffset` transition driven by the host's `group/weave`
 * hover/focus variants. Strand B's path starts at the opposite corner,
 * so the two tips cross at both meeting points (the 5-unit overshoot is
 * the "weave" moment).
 *
 * The svg deliberately has NO viewBox: rect geometry is in real pixels
 * (`calc(100% − inset)`), so there is no scale transform. Two earlier
 * shapes failed in rendering: a viewBox + `preserveAspectRatio="none"`
 * needs `vector-effect: non-scaling-stroke` for uniform strokes, and
 * that makes Chromium compute dash patterns in SCREEN space — silently
 * discarding the `pathLength` normalization all the dash math rests on.
 * Unscaled geometry keeps `pathLength` honored, strokes uniform, and the
 * corner radius identical to the host's at every size.
 *
 * ## States
 *
 * - Rest: strands hidden (offset = 100).
 * - Hover: strands draw over 500ms (ease-out).
 * - Focus-within: fully drawn — the signature doubles as the affordance.
 * - Reduced motion: no transition; strands appear drawn at rest-hover
 *   states instantly (`motion-reduce:transition-none`).
 *
 * ## Host contract
 *
 * The host element must carry `group/weave` and `relative`. Example:
 *
 *   <a className="group/weave relative …">
 *     <InterlaceWeave data-testid="card-weave" />
 *     …content…
 *   </a>
 *
 * ## API parity (R17)
 *
 * Mirrors the house decorative-overlay shape (magicui `BorderBeam`):
 * absolutely positioned, `aria-hidden`, `pointer-events-none` (R23
 * decorative-chrome rule). Radius follows the host via a rect `rx` that
 * matches the DS card radius token scale.
