# Internationalization Philosophy

A focused sub-philosophy of [UX_PHILOSOPHY.md](./UX_PHILOSOPHY.md), expanding
principle #10 (Every component answers "would this travel?") into the language
and locale surface. A component that travels across docs sites must also
travel across locales. Hardcoded English strings in a primitive are domain
coupling in disguise — they make the component portable in name but not in
practice.

This is the contract for how `@interlace/ui` primitives, blocks, and
patterns handle translatable content, text direction, and locale-aware
formatting.

## The core rule

> **No string in a primitive ships as a default. Every visible string crosses
> the prop boundary or comes from a translation function. Text direction is a
> CSS contract, not a JSX one. Numbers, dates, and currency go through
> `Intl.*`. Plurals respect locale rules.**

Three tests, in order:

1. **Can a consumer ship this component in French / Hebrew / Japanese without
   forking it?** If no, find the hardcoded string and lift it to a prop or a
   translation key.
2. **Does the layout survive RTL?** Mirror the JSX in a `dir="rtl"` story; if
   icons, padding, or arrows look wrong, the styles use directional values
   that should be logical (`ms-*` / `me-*` instead of `ml-*` / `mr-*`).
3. **Does the number / date / currency reflect the user's locale?** `1,234.56`
   in English, `1.234,56` in German, `१,२३४.५६` in Hindi. Hardcoded format
   strings are a regression.

## The 10 principles

Ordered by leverage.

### 1. No hardcoded strings in primitives

Primitives in `packages/ui/src/primitives/` ship zero default visible strings.
Every visible string is consumer-supplied via prop.

| ❌                                                | ✅                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<Dialog title="Are you sure?">`                  | `<Dialog title={t('dialog.confirmTitle')}>`                     |
| `closeLabel: string = "Close"`                    | `closeLabel: string` (required from consumer)                   |
| `<Button>Submit</Button>` baked into form blocks  | Block accepts `submitLabel` as a prop                           |

The exception: `aria-label` defaults for icons that have no other label
source (`aria-label="Previous slide"` on a carousel arrow). These are
overridable.

### 2. Logical CSS properties for direction

Use logical properties wherever a directional one exists. Tailwind v4 ships
the logical scale.

| ❌ Directional        | ✅ Logical                  |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `ml-2 mr-4`           | `ms-2 me-4`                 |
| `pl-3 pr-6`           | `ps-3 pe-6`                 |
| `text-left`           | `text-start`                |
| `border-l`            | `border-s`                  |
| `left-0 right-auto`   | `start-0 end-auto`          |

Icons that have directional meaning (chevrons, arrows) must flip in RTL.
Mark them with `rtl:rotate-180` or a Base UI / Radix primitive that owns the
direction.

### 3. `Intl.*` for all formatting

Numbers, dates, currency, units, lists, relative time, and plural forms go
through the platform `Intl` APIs. No `toLocaleString()` with hardcoded
locale; no manual format strings.

| Concern        | API                                                 |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Numbers        | `new Intl.NumberFormat(locale, options).format(n)`  |
| Currency       | `Intl.NumberFormat(locale, { style: 'currency' })`  |
| Dates          | `Intl.DateTimeFormat(locale, options).format(d)`    |
| Relative time  | `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat(locale).format(...)`       |
| Lists          | `Intl.ListFormat(locale).format([...])`             |
| Plurals        | `Intl.PluralRules(locale).select(n)`                |
| Display names  | `Intl.DisplayNames(locale, { type: 'language' })`   |

### 4. Plurals respect locale rules

English has 2 plural forms (one, other). Russian has 4. Arabic has 6. Welsh
has 6. Hardcoding `count === 1 ? "item" : "items"` breaks in most languages.

**Mechanics:** ICU MessageFormat (`i18next` ICU plugin, `intl-messageformat`,
or `@formatjs/intl`) is the floor. Translation key shape:

```text
{count, plural, =0 {No items} one {# item} other {# items}}
```

### 5. Translation keys are namespaced

Flat keys collide. Namespaced keys scale.

| ❌ Flat              | ✅ Namespaced                       |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `submit`             | `form.submit`                        |
| `error`              | `dialog.deleteConfirm.errorTitle`    |
| `loading`            | `table.loadingRows`                  |

### 6. Right-to-left is tested, not assumed

Every primitive ships a `dir="rtl"` story in Storybook. Visual regression
tests cover both directions. RTL bugs aren't found by review — they're
found by rendering.

**Mechanics:** Storybook globals `direction: 'ltr' | 'rtl'`; a `<DirectionWrapper>` decorator that flips it; Chromatic / Playwright VRT snapshots both directions.

### 7. String concatenation is broken

Concatenating fragments at the JSX level breaks word order in other languages.

| ❌ Concatenation                                  | ✅ Interpolated key                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<>{count} items in {bucketName}</>`              | `t('items.in', { count, bucketName })`                 |
| `"Welcome, " + userName`                          | `t('welcome', { userName })`                           |

The translation file owns word order; the source owns the variables.

### 8. Locale is a context, not a prop

Locale propagates via context (e.g. `IntlProvider` from react-intl, or
`I18nextProvider`). Primitives read it implicitly via hooks. No primitive
takes a `locale` prop — that's prop-drilling the global.

**Mechanics:** `useLocale()` hook returns the active locale; primitives that
need it call the hook. Consumer-side: the locale is determined once at the
app root (URL segment, cookie, `Accept-Language`) and provided.

### 9. Text expansion budgets

German text averages 30% longer than English. Russian and Arabic can hit
50%. UI that's tight at the English layout breaks elsewhere.

**Mechanics:**
- Button labels wrap (don't truncate by default) on locales > 1.3x English length.
- Avoid `whitespace-nowrap` on translatable strings unless the design genuinely needs single-line.
- Sidebar / nav labels reserve at least 1.5× English width; test with the longest known label.

### 10. Build with the ecosystem

`react-intl` / `i18next` / `next-intl` for state and message handling.
`Intl.*` for formatting. We don't ship our own translation engine.

**Forbidden:**
- `if (locale === 'en') { ... } else { ... }` in component source.
- Inline locale switches inside primitives.
- Translation files in `packages/ui/` — translation belongs to the app.

## How this gets used

When designing or reviewing a component, ask:

1. Are there any hardcoded visible strings in primitive source?
2. Are directional CSS properties logical (`ms-*`/`me-*`) where applicable?
3. Does every number/date/currency go through `Intl.*`?
4. Are plurals using ICU `plural` syntax, not ternaries?
5. Are translation keys namespaced?
6. Is there an RTL Storybook story?
7. Are translatable strings whole sentences, not concatenations?
8. Does locale come from context, not a prop?
9. Will the layout survive a 1.5× text-expansion locale?
10. Does the implementation reach for `react-intl` / `i18next` / `Intl.*`,
    not invent its own?

If any answer is no, the component is not yet shippable internationally.
