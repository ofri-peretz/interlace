# UTM Philosophy

A focused sub-philosophy of [URL_PHILOSOPHY.md](./URL_PHILOSOPHY.md)
(principle #5 "default values never appear in URLs" and principle #9 "sticky
parameters survive navigation") and
[ANALYTICS_PHILOSOPHY.md](./ANALYTICS_PHILOSOPHY.md), covering how `utm_*`
parameters carry inbound source and campaign context across the six
properties we ship.

This document is the portable rulebook for UTM in any property under our
ownership — the eslint docs site, the registry, the design system, the Nuxt
blog, the landing page, the storybook. UTM is a 25-year-old convention
everyone half-remembers; the value is in pinning it to a fixed taxonomy and a
single helper so the data joins cleanly when PostHog reads it.

---

## The core rule

> **`utm_*` is the source-of-truth attribution signal for cross-property
> traffic. The taxonomy is fixed, the construction goes through one blessed
> helper, the params are stripped from the visible URL after capture, and
> they never appear on internal navigation.**

Three tests, in order:

1. **Taxonomy test.** Does every `utm_source` and `utm_medium` value match
   the fixed list? Free-text values (`Blog`, `blog-1`, `BLOG`) destroy
   joinability — they don't compose into a "blog traffic" cohort, they split
   into three.
2. **Construction test.** Is the URL built by `buildUtmHref(href, opts)`, or
   by a template literal? Template literals bypass the taxonomy and the
   ESLint rule that enforces it.
3. **Strip test.** After the landing `$pageview` fires, does the address bar
   still show `?utm_source=…`? If yes, a re-share re-stamps source and the
   journey gets attributed to the wrong campaign forever.

## The taxonomy

Five slots, fixed values in the first two. Free-form values are forbidden
in `source` and `medium`; structured-slug-form is allowed in `campaign`,
`content`, and `term`.

| Slot           | Values                                                                                                                       | Example                       |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `utm_source`   | `ofriperetz_dev` `interlace` `eslint_docs` `serverless_docs` `ds` `storybook` `devto` `github` `npm` `x` `linkedin` `email`  | `utm_source=ofriperetz_dev`   |
| `utm_medium`   | `article` `blog` `docs` `landing` `social` `email` `referral` `cli`                                                          | `utm_medium=blog`             |
| `utm_campaign` | slug, derived from the content piece                                                                                         | `utm_campaign=flagship_rules` |
| `utm_content`  | slug, names the placement on the source page                                                                                 | `utm_content=hero_cta`        |
| `utm_term`     | free-form, optional (paid search, rarely used here)                                                                          | —                             |

The `utm_source` and `utm_medium` value sets are checked at build time by
the `conventions/utm-taxonomy` ESLint rule. Adding a new value edits the
rule first, the taxonomy table second, the call site third.

> **Deprecated: `dev_to` → `devto` (2026-07-17).** The blog's `/go/`
> redirect handler routes by `article_platforms.platform === utm_source`,
> and those platform rows are stored as `'devto'` — the un-underscored form
> is load-bearing and every published article link already carries it.
> `dev_to` never shipped in a real link and is no longer in the taxonomy;
> the ESLint rule flags it. Runtime consumers (visitor-profile inference)
> still accept `dev_to` on inbound URLs so historical links keep
> classifying correctly.

## The 10 principles

Ordered by leverage. Earlier principles, when violated, do the most damage.

### 1. One taxonomy, fixed values

A finite vocabulary is the only thing that makes UTM data joinable.
Free-text `utm_source=blog,Blog,BLOG-1` doesn't compose into a "blog
traffic" cohort — it splits into three rows that nothing in PostHog can
re-merge automatically.

**Forbidden:**
- New `utm_source` or `utm_medium` values that aren't in the taxonomy table.
- Capitalisation variants (`Blog` vs `blog`).
- Trailing version suffixes (`blog-v2`) — that belongs in `utm_campaign`,
  not in `utm_source`.

### 2. `utm_source` is the property, `utm_medium` is the channel

The two slots are independent. A link from a dev.to article counts as
`utm_source=devto&utm_medium=article` — dev.to is the property, article is
the channel. Conflating them (`utm_source=devto_article`) destroys both
axes of attribution.

### 3. Strip from the URL after capture

The first `$pageview` reads the params, then `history.replaceState` rewrites
the URL without them. The PostHog event already carries the source; leaving
the params visible invites two failure modes — re-shares attribute future
visits to the same campaign, and bookmarks bake a stale source in forever.

**Mechanics:**
- Stripping happens in the same client effect that captures the landing
  `$pageview`.
- The anchor (`#…`) survives. `ph_distinct_id` survives until the
  ANALYTICS_PHILOSOPHY principle 8 handler consumes it (one route-tick
  later).
- Cold-load equivalence (DEEP_LINKING_PHILOSOPHY principle 1) still holds
  after strip: the URL still resolves the same view, it just no longer
  carries campaign attribution.

### 4. Cross-property links always carry source

Outbound from `ofriperetz.dev` → `*.interlace.tools` MUST include UTM. Same
for outbound to `npm`, `github`, `dev.to`. Without this, the destination
cannot attribute the visitor, and PostHog can't draw the journey.

Internal cross-subdomain (`eslint.interlace.tools` → `ds.interlace.tools`)
does **not** add UTM — same eTLD+1, cookie carries identity, and
ANALYTICS_PHILOSOPHY principle 8 takes over.

### 5. Campaign maps to content, not to time

`utm_campaign` names the content piece (`flagship_rules_launch`,
`interop_announcement`), not a date window (`2026_q2`). Time windows are
derived from the event timestamp; baking them into the campaign name
double-counts the same content and forces every cohort to know dates.

### 6. Content slot names the placement

`utm_content=hero_cta`, `inline_link`, `footer_subscribe`. This is what
converted, not what the content was about. A single article with a hero CTA
and a footer CTA produces two distinct `utm_content` values from the same
`utm_campaign`.

### 7. No `utm_*` on internal navigation

The router strips them on internal nav. They only ever travel from outside a
property to inside. An internal link inside `eslint.interlace.tools` that
carries `utm_source=eslint_docs` is a bug — it overwrites the original
inbound source on every click and the journey forgets where the person
really came from.

### 8. Hash and identity survive UTM strip

The principle-3 strip removes `utm_*` only. `#section` survives
(DEEP_LINKING_PHILOSOPHY principle 2 — fragments are scroll targets, not
routes). `ph_distinct_id` survives until the
ANALYTICS_PHILOSOPHY principle 8 landing handler consumes it.

### 9. One blessed builder

`buildUtmHref(href, { source, medium, campaign, content })` is the only
blessed way to construct a cross-property URL. Hand-written strings are
forbidden by the `conventions/no-raw-cross-property-href` ESLint rule, which
flags any `<a href="https://*.interlace.tools/…">` or
`https://ofriperetz.dev/…` that doesn't come from the helper.

**Mechanics:**
- The helper validates source/medium against the taxonomy via a typed union;
  invalid values fail the build.
- For cross-eTLD+1 outbound, the helper also appends
  `ph_distinct_id=<current_id>` for identity stitching — see
  ANALYTICS_PHILOSOPHY principle 8.
- The helper is duplicated as `lib/utm.ts` in each property (Next or Nuxt).
  Duplication is intentional — low maintenance, no cross-repo versioning.
  The taxonomy stays consistent across copies via the
  `conventions/utm-taxonomy` ESLint rule, which reads the same fixed list.

### 10. UTM is one signal among several

`utm_*` answers "where did this person come from?" but not "is this the same
person who visited last week?" — that's the cookie + `ph_distinct_id` job.
A campaign analysis that joins UTM with identity tells the full story:
first-touch source, last-touch source, repeat-visit pattern. UTM alone
tells half the story.

## Cross-property travel matrix

The blessed builder picks the right combination per edge.

| From                       | To                          | utm_source       | utm_medium  | ph_distinct_id |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| `ofriperetz.dev`           | `*.interlace.tools`         | `ofriperetz_dev` | `blog`      | yes            |
| `ofriperetz.dev`           | `npm` / `github`            | `ofriperetz_dev` | `blog`      | no             |
| `interlace.tools`          | `*.interlace.tools`         | `interlace`      | `landing`   | no (same TLD)  |
| `eslint.interlace.tools`   | `ds.interlace.tools`        | (none)           | (none)      | no (same TLD)  |
| `eslint.interlace.tools`   | `npm` / `github` / `dev.to` | `eslint_docs`    | `docs`      | no             |
| `*.interlace.tools`        | `ofriperetz.dev`            | `interlace`      | `landing`   | yes            |

`utm_campaign` and `utm_content` are content-bound; the call site sets them.

## How this gets used

When adding a cross-property link, ask:

1. Are `utm_source` and `utm_medium` values from the fixed taxonomy?
2. Is the URL built by `buildUtmHref()`, not a template literal?
3. Does `utm_campaign` name the content piece, not a date window?
4. Does `utm_content` name the placement, not the topic?
5. Does the destination strip `utm_*` from the URL after capture?
6. For cross-eTLD+1 outbound, does the helper also append `ph_distinct_id`?
7. For internal nav, is the link free of `utm_*` entirely?
8. Does the ESLint rule flag any hand-written cross-property URL?

If any answer is no, the link is not yet shippable.

## Living document

When a campaign or property arises this doc didn't anticipate, extend the
taxonomy first (the ESLint rule will refuse hand-rolled values otherwise),
then ship. The taxonomy is the contract — drift in it makes the analytics
drift downstream.
